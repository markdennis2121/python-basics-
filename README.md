# 🐍 Python Fundamentals Practice – by Mark Dennis

This repository contains foundational Python code I wrote while practicing the basics—starting from beginner-level syntax up through defining functions and handling errors. It's all compiled into a single file (`practice.py`) that walks through key elements of the language as I built my understanding.

## 📘 What's Included

The file includes progressive examples of:

- 🔤 Variable declarations and string manipulation
- 🔁 Loops (`for`, `while`) and control structures
- 🧠 Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- 🧩 Functions with parameters and return values
- 🛑 Exception handling using `try`, `except`, `finally`
- 🎯 Mini-games and interactive examples (e.g., guessing game)
- 📥 User input and basic I/O operations

## 🛠 How to Run

In your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
